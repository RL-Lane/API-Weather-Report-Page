## Description  
This project demonstrates the ability to design a simple website using Bootstrap.  This provides a responsive design that updates when a window is resized, and is also mobile-friendly without serving a separate page.

One critical feature added in this project is a separate navigation bar (navbar.html).  This saved troubleshooting and development time later on in the project as links were modified or added, because navbar links then only needed to be changed in one location, rather than locating the same code in every page.  For this to work, JQuery was included in order to load the navbar.html into each page.
